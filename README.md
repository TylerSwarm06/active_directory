# Installing Domain Controller
1. Use 'SConfig' to:
 - Change the hostname
 - Change the IP to static
 - Change the DNS Server to our own IP address

2. Install the Active Directory Windows Feature

```shell
Install-WindowsFeature AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools

Import-Module ADDSDeployment

Install-ADDSForest
```
3. Set static IP on correct interface

Find the index of the interface hosting the current IP address
```shell
Get-NetIPAddress -IPAddress '192.168.1.38'
```
Ensure DHCP is disabled on this interface.
```shell
Get-NetIPInterface -InterfaceIndex 4 | Set-NetIPInterface -Dhcp Disabled
```
Otherwise, you will get an error message:
New-NetIPAddress : The object already exists.

 Set the interfaceâ€™s DNS server
```shell
Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceIndex 4 -ServerAddresses 192.168.1.38
```
# Join Workstation to domain

1. Repeat steps from above to set correct DNS 

2. Join Workstation to domain
```shell
Add-Computer -DomainName xyz.com -Credential xyz\Administrator -Force
```
3. This brings up a GUI login prompt. Enter the domain administrator credentials. The workstation is now joined to the domain.
